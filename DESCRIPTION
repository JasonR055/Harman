Description: Harman is a PCA and constrained optimisation based
        technique that maximises the removal of batch effects from
        datasets, with the constraint that the probability of
        overcorrection (i.e. removing genuine biological signal along
        with batch noise) is kept to a fraction which is set by the
        end-user.
