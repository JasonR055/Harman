Description: Harman is a PCA and constrained optimisation based technique that
    maximises the removal of batch effects from datasets, with the constraint
    that the probability of overcorrection (i.e. removing genuine biological
    signal along with batch noise) is kept to a fraction which is set by the
    end-user.
